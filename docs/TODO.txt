* merge ranges across (consecutive) calls
    - naive impl.: only check consecutive calls (no multitasking)
    - zero-fill, cache unmap range (clear if written), check if whole chunk
* check partition -> TRIM -> shrink -> delete orphan empty chunks
* sparse chunk?
* differential (take snapshots and merge later) disk (xor or copy?)
