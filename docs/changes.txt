v0.1

* Initial release.

v0.2

* Make sure to update the last modified time.

v0.3

* Flush all only if whole chunk is explicitly requested to be flushed, let Windows decide otherwise.
* Update the last modified time in fine resolution.

v0.4

* Use unbuffered I/O instead of memory mappings.
* Chunk size must be a multiple of 4096. This breaks backward compatibility.
* Add an option -t to adjust number of I/O threads.
* Performance tunings.

v0.5

* Use buffered I/O to improve performance. But the drive stutters when Windows flushes written buffer to the backing chunk.

v0.6

* Create .lock file to prevent re-mounting.
* Add `chunkdisk-t` class in `install.reg` to set the number of I/O threads by `launchctl-x64.exe start chunkdisk-t InstanceName File.chunkdisk Number`.

v0.9

* Fix chunks created and written when unmapped partially.
* Use unbuffered, asynchronous I/O.
* Make I/O scheduling deterministic for better sequential performance on HDDs.
* Merge unmap ranges across requests for better space efficiency.
* Flush file metadata after one minute of inactivity.
